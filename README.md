# Awesome Méliès Addons

This is a (currently small) list of useful or well made addons for Méliès.

## How to install an Addon

Installing an addon is very easy and is only a few steps.

1. Download the desired .json addon file.
2. Open the addons folder using the "Open Addons Folder" button at the bottom of the settings menu (it will be hidden if you have the addons section closed). 
3. Drag the downloaded .json file into the addons folder.
4. Done!

You don't even need to restart Méliès for it to take effect, just close and re-open the settings menu.
